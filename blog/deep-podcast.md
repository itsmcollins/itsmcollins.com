I am a massive fan of the Deep Research products that exist in the world today. 
Like many, I find the ability to go in thorough depth on a given topic in mere moments to be extremely empowering.
Deep Research has served as a vehicle for me to explore in good rigour the random intellectual curiorisities I stumble upon on a regular basis.

That said, sometimes I don't want to read a 20-page report. Especially not when it involves holding my phone close to my face, zooming into each line
while trying to commute on the Tube. In fact, sometimes I find the podcast format freeing - mainly for my retinas, but also for ingesting information through dynamic discourse, discussion and debate.

To solve this, I built Deep Podcast. 

Deep Podcast allows me to send a WhatsApp message with a topic that I want to do a deep dive on. After generating a thorough report on the topic, Deep Podcast calls upon a team of AI agents to organise a podcast, then passes the baton over to an agentic podcast host and guest that discuss the topic in depth. When the podcast is ready, I get the audio for listening at my leisure.

I am an advocate of messaging interfaces like WhatsApp and iMessage as the form factor for triggering long-running agentic tasks. Humans are accustomed to the idea of sending a message to another human and not expecting an instanteous response. In this way, messaging Deep Podcast to kick off a new podcast feels super intuitive. The entire flow from WhatsApp message to audio can take 15 minutes, so it is nice to have a familiar expectation of giving someone the time and space of getting back to you when they're ready.

Currently Deep Podcasts are roughly 7 minutes long. It ends up being enough to cover most bases on a given report, but I do acknowledge that longer form podcasts allow for exploring topics in significantly more depth. There's plenty of scope for improving: the personalities of the podcast host and guest, the nature of the discussion, and (importantly) optimised financing for deep research and text-to-speech models.
